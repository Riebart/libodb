This is the repo for the libodb project.

The libodb source code is in the 'src' directory.
Testing code such as unit tests and glue scripts are in the 'test' directory.
Sample and demo application code is in the 'extra' folder.
Additional libraries that may be of use are in the 'extralib' folder.

To perform an out-of-source build (which prevents CMake from contaminating the source tree with intermediate files) of libodb:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

While in the build directory...

To build the supplementary items:

    make extra
    make extralib

To check your build:

    make check
    make check-extra
    make check-extralib
    
To build (but not run) the test programs:

    make checks
    make checks-extra
    make checks-extralib

To build the documentation:

    make doc
    make doc-extra
    make doc-extralib
