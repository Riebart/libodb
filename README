This is the repo for the libodb project.

The libodb source code is in the 'src' directory.
Testing code such as unit tests and glue scripts are in the 'test' directory.
Sample and demo application code is in the 'extra' folder.
Additional libraries that may be of use are in the 'extralib' folder.

Supported environment variables are:

    NO_FORCE_64_BIT
    FORCE_I386
    SKIP_SUN_COMPILER
    NO_OPTIMIZE
    SKIP_TCMALLOC
    USE_CLANG

To perform an out-of-source build (which prevents CMake from contaminating the source tree with intermediate files) of libodb:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

While in the build directory...

To build the supplementary items:

    make extra
    make extralib

To check your build:

    make check
    make check-extra
    make check-extralib
    
To build (but not run) the test programs:

    make checks
    make checks-extra
    make checks-extralib

To build the doc target you'll need 
   - Documentation:  doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) - Required for documentation generation
   - Code Metrics:   cccc (http://cccc.sourceforge.net/)             - Optional
   - LaTeX PDF Docs: LaTeX (http://www.tug.org/texlive/)             - Optional
